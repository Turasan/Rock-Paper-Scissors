# Rock-Paper-Scissors
In each round of the game, you'll choose one of three possible moves: rock, paper, or scissors. The computer will also make its choice. The winner of the round is determined based on the classic rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. The first player to win a predetermined number of rounds is declared the overall winner.
